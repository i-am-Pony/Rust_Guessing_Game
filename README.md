# Rust_Guessing_Game
I am learning to code in Rust.. You can follow along and see as I learn. This is my 3rd program in Rust on my long Journey, and the first that was probably useful outside of learning the environment. It is a simple guessing game.
Rather than posting the steps here, as my own, I have added the direct to link to the chapter in "The Rust Book" where they walk you through it. The Rust Book is a must for anyone wanting to dive into Rust.

Good luck a Happy Hacking!
